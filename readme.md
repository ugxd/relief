## about
relief is a programming language that was designed to be more simpler and cleaner than any programming language in existence.
so, instead of:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  cout<<"this is an example of c++ code"
}
```
it will be:
```relief
when project start {
  out ("this is an example of relief code")
}
```
see it much cleaner than the first code? thats the purpose of relief.
