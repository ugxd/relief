relief is open-source, and contributing is welcome. you can contribute freely, but heres the catch:
- fork the repo and make your changes in it, unless youre the contributor of this repo
- write clear, concise commit messages
- make sure your code works, and does not break existing functionality. i may/may not be mad
- respect the license. relief is licensed under gnu gpl-3.0
- have fun contributing this repo, or still (?)
if you contributed this, no matter small or big, every little helps
BUT if you violate any of these and when i checked you did purposely, youre banned from contributing this project

tysm for helping relief better if you did </3
